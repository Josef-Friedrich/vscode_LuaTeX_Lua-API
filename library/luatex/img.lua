_N._11_1_3_scan = 0

---
---When you say `img.scan(a)` for a new image, the file is scanned, and
---variables such as `xsize`, `ysize`, image `type`, number of
---`pages`, and the resolution are extracted. Each of the `width`, `height`, `depth` fields are set up according to the image dimensions, if
---they were not given an explicit value already. An image file will never be
---scanned more than once for a given image variable. With all subsequent `img.scan(a)` calls only the dimensions are again set up (if they have been
---changed by the user in the meantime).
---
---For ease of use, you can do right-away a
---
---```lua
---<image> a = img.scan { filename = "foo.png" }
---```
---
---without a prior `img.new`.
---
---Nothing is written yet at this point, so you can do `a=img.scan`, retrieve
---the available info like image width and height, and then throw away `a`
---again by saying `a=nil`. In that case no image object will be reserved in
---the PDF, and the used memory will be cleaned up automatically.
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---
---@return Image
function img.scan(image) end

_N._11_1_4_copy = 0

---
---If you say `a = b`, then both variables point to the same `<image>`
---object. if you want to write out an image with different sizes, you can do
---`b = img.copy(a)`.
---
---Afterwards, `a` and `b` still reference the same actual image
---dictionary, but the dimensions for `b` can now be changed from their
---initial values that were just copies from `a`.
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---
---@return Image
function img.copy(image) end

_N._11_1_5_write_immediatewrite_immediatewriteobject = 0

---
---By `img.write(a)` a *PDF* object number is allocated, and a rule node of
---subtype `image` is generated and put into the output list. By this the
---image `a` is placed into the page stream, and the image file is written out
---into an image stream object after the shipping of the current page is finished.
---
---Again you can do a terse call like
---
---```
---img.write { filename = "foo.png" }
---```
---
---The `<image>` variable is returned in case you want it for later
---processing. You can also write an object.
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---
---@return Image
function img.write(image) end

---
---By `img.immediatewrite(a)` a *PDF* object number is allocated, and the
---image file for image `a` is written out immediately into the *PDF* file as
---an image stream object (like with `immediate``\pdfximage`). The object
---number of the image stream dictionary is then available by the `objnum`
---key. No `pdf_refximage` whatsit node is generated. You will need an
---`img.write(a)` or `img.node(a)` call to let the image appear on the
---page, or reference it by another trick; else you will have a dangling image
---object in the *PDF* file.
---
---Also here you can do a terse call like
---
---```
---a = img.immediatewrite { filename = "foo.png" }
---```
---
---The `<image>` variable is returned and you will most likely need it.
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---
---@return Image
function img.immediatewrite(image) end

---
---The next function is kind of special as it copies an object from a (*PDF*) image
---file. This features is experimental and might disappear.
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---@param objnum integer
---
---@return Image
function img.immediatewriteobject(image, objnum) end

_N._11_1_6_node = 0

---
---This function allocates a *PDF* object number and returns a whatsit node of
---subtype `pdf_refximage`, filled with the image parameters `width`,
---`height`, `depth`, and `objnum`. Also here you can do a terse
---call like:
---
---```
---n = img.node ({ filename = "foo.png" })
---```
---
---This example outputs an image:
---
---```
---node.write(img.node{filename="foo.png"})
---```
---
---@param image Image|ImageSpec
---
---@return Node
function img.node(image) end

_N._11_1_7_types = 0

---
---This function returns a list with the supported image file type names, currently
---these are `pdf`, `png`, `jpg`, `jp2` (JPEG 2000), and
---`jbig2`.
---
---```lua
---types = img.types()
---```
---
---@return table
function img.types() end

_N._11_1_8_boxes = 0

---
---This function returns a list with the supported *PDF* page box names, currently
---these are `media`, `crop`, `bleed`, `trim`, and `art`, all in lowercase.
---
---```lua
---boxes = img.boxes()
---```
---
---@return table
