---This function should be used with care. It acts as `endinput` but at
---the *Lua* end. Normally
---*Lua* will just collect prints and at the end bump an input level and flush these
---prints. This function can help you stay at the current level but you need to know
---what you're doing (or more precise: what *TeX* is doing with input).
