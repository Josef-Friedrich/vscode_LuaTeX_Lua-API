---# Extra `os` library functions
---
---The `os` library has a few extra functions and variables: `os.selfdir`, `os.exec`, `os.spawn`, `os.setenv`,
---`os.env`, `os.gettimeofday`, `os.times`, `os.tmpdir`, `os.type`, `os.name` and `os.uname`,
---that we will discuss here.
---
----------------------------------------------------------------
os = {}

---
---A variable that holds the directory path of the
---actual executable.
---
---For example: `\directlua {tex.sprint(os.selfdir)`}.

---
---For example `/usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-linux`
---@string
os.selfdir = ""

---
---A variation on `os.execute`.
---
---Here
---`commandline` can be either a single string or a single table.
---
---* If the argument is a table *LuaTeX* first checks if there is a value at
---  integer index zero. If there is, this is the command to be executed.
---  Otherwise, it will use the value at integer index one. If neither are
---  present, nothing at all happens.
---
---* The set of consecutive values starting at integer 1 in the table are the
---  arguments that are passed on to the command (the value at index 1 becomes
---  `arg[0]`). The command is searched for in the execution path, so
---  there is normally no need to pass on a fully qualified path name.
---
---* If the argument is a string, then it is automatically converted into a
---  table by splitting on whitespace. In this case, it is impossible for the
---  command and first argument to differ from each other.
---
---* In the string argument format, whitespace can be protected by putting
---  (part of) an argument inside single or double quotes. One layer of quotes
---  is interpreted by *LuaTeX*, and all occurrences of `\"`, `\'`
---  or `\\` within the quoted text are unescaped. In the table format,
---  there is no string handling taking place.
---
---This function normally does not return control back to the *Lua* script: the
---command will replace the current process. However, it will return the two
---values `nil` and `error` if there was a problem while
---attempting to execute the command.
---
---On MS Windows, the current process is actually kept in memory until after the
---execution of the command has finished. This prevents crashes in situations
---where *TeXLua* scripts are run inside integrated *TeX* environments.
---
---The original reason for this command is that it cleans out the current
---process before starting the new one, making it especially useful for use in
---*TeX*LUA.

---
---@param commandline string|table
function os.exec(commandline) end

---
---A returning version of `os.exec`,
---with otherwise identical calling conventions.
---
---If the command ran ok, then the return value is the exit status of the
---command. Otherwise, it will return the two values `nil` and `error`.
